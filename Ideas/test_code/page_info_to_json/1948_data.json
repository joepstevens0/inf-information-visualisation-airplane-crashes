The crew discharged carbon dioxide extinguishers into the cargo hold in response to the fire warning. When the plane's nose was lowered for an emergency descent, the carbon dioxide, being heavier than air, accumulated in the cockpit and asphyxiated the crew.The aircraft crashed through high voltage lines and exploded on a hillside. After the crashes of 10/24/47 and 11/11/47, were a design flaw allowed vented fuel to enter the intake for the cabin heating system, the CAA also ordered carbon dioxide extinguishers installed. Earl Carroll,U.S. theatrical impresario killed. Douglas aircraft company knew of the carbon dioxide danger after two of its test pilots were almost overcome during test flights.
