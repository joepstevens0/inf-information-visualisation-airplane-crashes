The inappropriate control inputs applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt, the failure of the non-flying pilot-in-command to recognize, address and correct these inappropriate control inputs, and the failure of Airborne Express to establish a formal, functional evaluation flight program that included adequate program guidelines, requirements and pilot training for performance of these flights. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inoperative stick shaker stall warning system and Airborne Express DC-8 flight training simulator's inadequate fidelity in reproducing the airplane's stall characteristics.", "coordinates": "?", "near_coordinates": "?"}, {"date": "December 24, 1996", "time": "1500", "location": "Near Nellore, India", "operator": "Military - Indian Air Force", "flight#": "?", "route": "Tanbaram AFB - Hyderabad", "actype": "Hindustan Aeronautics 748-2", "registration": "H1032", "cn/ln": "528", "aboard": "22", "aboard_passengers": "17", "aboard_crew": "5", "fatalities": "22", "fatalities_passengers": "17", "fatalities_crew": "5", "ground": "0", "summary": "Crashed while en route after the pilot reported an engine fire.
