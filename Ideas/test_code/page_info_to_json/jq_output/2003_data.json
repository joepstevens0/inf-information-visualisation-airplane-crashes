"The commuter plane was not able to maintain altitude after taking off from Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and crashed into the side of a hanger and burst into flames. The weather was clear, cold and windy, with greater than 10 miles visibility at the time of the accident. The airplane's loss of pitch control during takeoff was the result of incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplane's center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was"
" (1) Air Midwest's lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station, (2) Air Midwest's maintenance procedures and documentation, (3) Air Midwest's weight and balance program at the time of the accident, (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspector's failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system, (5) the FAA's average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident and (6) the FAA's lack of oversight of Air Midwest's maintenance program and its weight and balance program."

Although the right engine was feathered, flaps and gear retracted and full power applied t the left engine, the plane could not maintain altitude and the pilot ditched the aircraft 15 miles from its destination. All passengers and the pilot were able to exit from the plane before it sank but 2 passengers subsequently died. The in-flight failure of the right engine and the pilot's failure to adequately manage the airplane's performance after the engine failed. The right engine failure resulted for inadequate maintenance that was performed by Air Sunshine's maintenance personnel during undocumented maintenance. Contributing to the passenger fatalities was the pilot's failure to provide an emergency briefing after the right engine failed."
