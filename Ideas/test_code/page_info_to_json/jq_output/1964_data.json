One passenger died after free-falling out of the No. 4 emergency escape window of the plane in an attempt to escape the onboard fire. The ignition source was never determined, but it is thought the plane's battery or something in a passenger's luggage caused the fire.Testing revealed lethal amounts of CO2 could be discharged into the cockpit instead of the lower baggage compartment. The plane was seen flying erratically and the fire eventually burned through the controls.It is likely the crew was unconscious by then."
