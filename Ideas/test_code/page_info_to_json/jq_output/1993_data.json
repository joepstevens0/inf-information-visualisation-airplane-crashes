"The cargo plane crashed 1/4 of a mile short of the runway, while on approach. the captain had decided, for no particular reason, toland from the west, requiring a sharp turn just before the runway to stay within the US-controlled military base. He then became fixated on sighting the strobe light marking the border, not having been informed that it was not working. Primary cause was impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue."

"The aircraft skidded offthe end of the runway while landing. The crew was made aware of windshear at approach end of runway but not of poor water drainage on the runway nor a change in wind direction. A very light touch of the runway surface with the landing gear and lack of compression of the left landing gear leg to the extent understood by the aircraft computer as the actual landing, resulted in delayed deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers. The delay was about 9 seconds. Thus, the braking commenced with delay and in a condition of heavy rain and strong tailwind the aircraft did not stop on the runway. The aircraft was named \"Kulbach.\""
