The failure of the captain to adhere to instrument procedures in the Newark area during an approach to the Oakland MunicipalAirport."

Hold-down studs in the number 10 cylinder of the right engine failed due to improper installtion of their nuts. Fire erupted at the base of the failed cylinder. Extension of the landing gear and loss of the right engine led to the aircraft stalling at the height of about 200 ft. The aircraft was also overloaded by 117 pounds. A stall with the landing gear extended following a serious loss of power from the right engine. This loss of power was caused by the failure of the hold-down studs of the No. 10 cylinder, precipitating a fire in flight which became uncontrollable."
