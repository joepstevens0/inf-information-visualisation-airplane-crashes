Thirty-two British and 17 Americans were on board, and the survivors were 5 British and 1 American.The fatalities included the designer, Charles Campbell, who had copied a captured German design intended for high-altitude flight, therefore the skeleton was a bit weaker than some.The pilot overstressed it by attempting a turn at 62 mph at low altitude."
