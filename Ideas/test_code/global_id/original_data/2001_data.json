The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed.",

The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \\Caution\\ note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak.",

In addition, despite the poor visibility and inadequately marked airport landmarks, the control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood.

    "summary": "Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.",

    "summary": "The aircraft was flying through a mix of rain and snow on final approach, when it crashed in a wooded area, 5.5 miles from Zurich Airport where it was scheduled to land on Runway 28.At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a \\minimum\\ warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.The range of hills the plane crashed into was not marked in the Jeppesen approach chart used by the crew, despite the hilly terrain the approach to runway 28 was not equipped with a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) system, which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated, and the airport's means of determining visibility were inadequate for runway 28 and the visual minimums at the time of the accident were actually inappropriate for using the standard approach to runway 28.",
